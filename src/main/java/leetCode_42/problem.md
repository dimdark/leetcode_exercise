Trapping Rain Water
---
Description<br/>
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
 compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. 

In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
